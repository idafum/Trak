A study timer for focused work.

## Why Trak?
Trak helps you understand **where your time actually goes**

Its secondary goal is to help you lock in during focused study sessions.

With Trak, you can see statements like:

- *“I’ve spent 12.5 hours learning Swift.”*

- *“I’ve spent 8 hours studying Cybersecurity.”*
