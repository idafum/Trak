## Trak  
A terminal-first CLI study tracker built for developers and students.

## Why Trak  
Built for people who live in the terminal and want an offline way to track real **focused sessions**.

No accounts • No cloud • No distractions

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under a minute:

### 1. Initialize Trak  
Set up your local workspace (runs once):

### 3. Start tracking

### 4. Control your session  

Take a break when life happens:

### 5. Finish and save the session

`trak session end`

### 6. Finish and discard the session
